Dynamic Forth version 0.1

0. Apologize:
First of all, I must admit that English is not my mother tongue so 
I apologize in advance for all the English mistake that I will make.

1. Introduction:
I was thinking about a minimal scripting language;
a really easy user friendly language for writing simple scripts.
I had an idea: What will happen if I mix forth and scheme.
What will happen if forth was dynamic language with lambdas (blocks)?
What will happen if functions will get values backward from the stack
but the syntax will read the next words forward?
I already know about Factor language but it feels too low level for my taste.

To test my language you will have to do the following steps:
  a. Type "perl dynamic-forth.pl < test.df > test.scm" in Bash.
  b. Run test.scm with a scheme compiler. 
 
2. About me:
I live in Israel. I am working in costumer service, dreaming about
being entrepreneur and create my own company.
My email address is ylando2@gmail.com please contact me; 
if you have a serious job to offer me or 
if you want to contribute to my open source projects.

3. Motivation:
I have the following use cases for my language:
  a. It can be use to replace the Linux dc command.
  b. We can compile the programs to guile scheme and use it instead of guile.
  c. I have an idea of a real time strategy game, where the players
     use only the keyboard to control their units. In this game every player
     will be able to use this language to control their units.

4. List of files:
This directory contain the following files:
  a. dynamic-forth.pl - The compiler that compiles dynamic forth to scheme.
  b. API - The language API.
  c. TODO - A list of ideas to implement in the next versions of the language.
  d. GRAMMAR - The BNF grammar for my language.
  e. test.df - A program written in dynamic forth to test the compiler.
